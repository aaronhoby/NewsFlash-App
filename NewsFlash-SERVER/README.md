# NewsFlash Backend Server

Backend for the NewsFlash app, written in Python and hosted on Heroku. Built with Flask and a whole lot of other stuff.

_Part of a CS198-001 Project by [@chromadrive](github.com/chromadrive) [@zeyanaAM](github.com/zeyanaam) and [@aaronhoby](github.com/aaronhoby)_

This API is hosted live at [http://newsapp-backend2.herokuapp.com/](http://newsapp-backend2.herokuapp.com/) ! Works better than building this source and running it yourself :)

## Usage

- `/feed/` returns the JSON representation of the frontpage feed.
- `/search/[TYPE]/[QUERY]` returns the JSON representation of a searched feed. `[TYPE]` can be either Keyword, Location, or Category, where words are seperated by either `_` or `%20`
 - See notes on valid categories below
- `/event/[URI]` takes in an event URI of the form `lang-####` and returns a JSON representation of the article.

## Format
Feeds (main feed, search):

- `events`
  -  For each event:
  -  `URI`
  -  `category`
  -  `date`
  -  `image`
  -  `location`
  -  `socialScore`
  -  `title`

Events:

- `event`
  - `title`
  - `URI`
  - `articles` (a list of strings)
  - `category`
  - `date`
  - `image`
  - `keywords` (a list of strings)
  - `location`
  - `socialScore`
  - `summary`

- If a query can't be resolved or otherwise errors, then the API will return only an `error` entry stating the error


## Cache

For testing purposes, we've cached a version of the backend with events around 11/28-12/2. It can be accessed by putting `/cache/` in front of every call (for example, accessing an event would be `/cache/event/[URI]`. 

Some searches are also cached:

- Keyword: `Trump`, `iPhone`, `Star Wars`, `Black Friday`
- Location: `United States`, `United Kingdom`, `Saudi Arabia`, `China`
- Category: `Society`, `Science`, `Arts`

Remember to replace spaces with `_` or `%20`!

## Installation and Operation
0) Make sure you have a working Python 3.5 or higher installation, this won't work on anything lower.

1) Install NLTK and download the `stopwords` corpus. There are plenty of instructions on how to do this online.

2) Install all the stuff in `requirements.txt` (preferably in a virtualenv). You can do this with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

3) Open `event.py`, and at the top, insert your EventRegistry API key as a string into the `apiKey = ` field.

4) Run `web.py` (preferably Docker, but `python3 web.py` also works), and navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:5000/` on your web browser.
