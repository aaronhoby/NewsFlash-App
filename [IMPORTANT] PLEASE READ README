Please read README.md; there's some very important stuff in there about what to grade, but TL;DR:
  - Run NewsFlash-CLIENT first
    (that's the live version)
  - If that doesn't work, run NewsFlash-CLIENT-CACHED
    (that's the cached version, but the app is the same)
    - If you end up grading the cached version, please see readme.md for example search/browse queries
  - The server (NewsFlash-SERVER) is missing a few important files and will likely not run
