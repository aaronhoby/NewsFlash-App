## Important Info about the Backend

The backend code included is incomplete and may not run properly, please see our backend's [development repo](https://github.com/chromadrive/NewsFlash-backend) or the `readme.md` in the backend folder for more info.

But the main reason you're here is the iOS app, isn't it?

## Getting Started
0) Navigate to the backend API ([http://newsapp-backend2.herokuapp.com/](http://newsapp-backend2.herokuapp.com/)) using a web browser and make sure it hasn't crashed.

1) Install the CocoaPods: `pod install`

2) Open XCode and launch the app, everything should already be working.
