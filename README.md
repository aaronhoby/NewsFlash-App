# NewsFlash

_CS198-001 Project by [@chromadrive](github.com/chromadrive) [@zeyanaAM](github.com/zeyanaam) and [@aaronhoby](github.com/aaronhoby)_

## Super Duper Important Info
### (Please Read!)

Our main project is in the `NewsFlash-CLIENT` folder, and our backend is in `NewsFlash-SERVER`.

However, the live version of the backend is quite unstable and is very crash-happy, and as a result `NewsFlash-CLIENT` may not work. If that happens, please either email me (`wxiong @ berkeley`) so I can get the live version back up and running, or try running `NewsFlash-CLIENT-CACHED`. It's the same app, but runs on a cached version of our server.

If you do end up having to resort to using the cached app, you can test our search/browse functionality with these queries:

- Search: `Trump`, `iPhone`, `Star Wars`, `Black Friday`
- Browse Location: `United States`, `United Kingdom`, `Saudi Arabia`, `China`
- Browse Category: `Society`, `Science`, `Arts`

## About the Backend...

The backend code included is incomplete and may not run properly, please see our backend's [development repo](https://github.com/chromadrive/NewsFlash-backend) or the `readme.md` in the backend folder for more info.

But the main reason you're here is the iOS app, isn't it?

## Getting Started
0) Navigate to the backend API ([http://newsapp-backend2.herokuapp.com/](http://newsapp-backend2.herokuapp.com/)) using a web browser and make sure it hasn't crashed.

1) Install the CocoaPods: `pod install`

2) Open XCode and launch the app, everything should already be working.
